# 1) Langchain

 LangChain is a framework or library designed to facilitate the creation, testing, and deployment of applications that leverage language models, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, in innovative ways. The term "chain" metaphorically represents how different components—such as language models, databases, APIs, and custom logic—can be linked together to process input, generate outputs, solve problems, or automate tasks that involve natural language understanding and generation.
