# Gen AI Foundations training

Welcome to the Gen AI Foundations Training repository! This repo aims to provide Data Scientists with a comprehensive understanding of key tools necessary to build a strong toolkit in Generative AI. It covers the following topics:

1) Prompt Engineering: Learn how to craft effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.
2) Langchain: Understand how to utilize LangChain for building applications with large language models.
3) Entity Recognition (**WIP - Work in progress**): Master techniques for identifying and classifying key information from text data.
4) Agents (**WIP - Work in progress**): Explore the concept of agents in AI and how they can be used to automate tasks and decision-making processes.
