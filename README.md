# 1) Langchain (source: https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)

 LangChain is a framework or library designed to facilitate the creation, testing, and deployment of applications that leverage language models, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, in innovative ways. The term "chain" metaphorically represents how different components—such as language models, databases, APIs, and custom logic—can be linked together to process input, generate outputs, solve problems, or automate tasks that involve natural language understanding and generation.

 Example: a "chain" might involve a process where an initial language model interprets a user's query, another component retrieves relevant information from a database or the internet, and then another language model synthesizes that information into a coherent and informative response. This chaining approach allows developers to create sophisticated AI applications that can handle a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating text to more complex decision-making and problem-solving activities.
